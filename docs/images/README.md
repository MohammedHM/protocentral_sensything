# Images

In this directory, put the following types of images:

* brand/company logo 
* product images
* avatar images (e.g., head shots) for each person on your team

## Filename Conventions

Image filenames can only contain lowercase letters and numbers,
hyphens, and a single period to separate the file extension. For
example, `morning-sunrise-3.jpg` is acceptable, but
`MorningSunrise3.jpg` and `Morning\ Sunrise\ 3.JPG` are not.

## Captions

To add captions to images, edit the `captions.md` file and reference
each image by its filename.
